    """Abstract base class for all event loops.

    Event loops act as the bottom layer for Nvim sessions created by this
    library. They hide system/transport details behind a simple interface for
    reading/writing bytes to the connected Nvim instance.

    This class exposes public methods for interacting with the underlying
    event loop and delegates implementation-specific work to the following
    methods, which subclasses are expected to implement:

    - `_init()`: Implementation-specific initialization
    - `_connect_tcp(address, port)`: connect to Nvim using tcp/ip
    - `_connect_socket(path)`: Same as tcp, but use a UNIX domain socket or
      or named pipe.
    - `_connect_stdio()`: Use stdin/stdout as the connection to Nvim
    - `_connect_child(argv)`: Use the argument vector `argv` to spawn an
      embedded Nvim that has it's stdin/stdout connected to the event loop.
    - `_start_reading()`: Called after any of _connect_* methods. Can be used
      to perform any post-connection setup or validation.
    - `_send(data)`: Send `data`(byte array) to Nvim. The data is only
    - `_run()`: Runs the event loop until stopped or the connection is closed.
      calling the following methods when some event happens:
      actually sent when the event loop is running.
      - `_on_data(data)`: When Nvim sends some data.
      - `_on_signal(signum)`: When a signal is received.
      - `_on_error(message)`: When a non-recoverable error occurs(eg:
        connection lost)
    - `_stop()`: Stop the event loop
    - `_interrupt(data)`: Like `stop()`, but may be called from other threads
      this.
    - `_setup_signals(signals)`: Add implementation-specific listeners for
      for `signals`, which is a list of OS-specific signal numbers.
    - `_teardown_signals()`: Removes signal listeners set by `_setup_signals`
